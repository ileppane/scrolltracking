<p>
    This is a demo of the scroll tracking app in a mobile device. Each decision round presents two options and the user scrolls between them to choose. The app tracks their response in the pixel-time space and calculates metrics that can be used to analyse attention given by the scrolls.

<p>
    Device should be kept in portrait mode. If you are using a non-mobile browser, you can imitate a mobile environment by switching to a "responsive design mode" (e.g. in Firefox: Tools => Browser tools).
