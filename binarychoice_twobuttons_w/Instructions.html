This study consists of two parts. In Part 1, you will be asked to express a preference for different kinds of fine watches. In Part 2, you will be asked to make choices between pairs of watches. 
</p>

<p>
    We have watches from both men's and women's categories, using the website of well-known international brand (Longines). We first ask you from which category you would like to see the products. This information is only used by the computer to choose products from either of the categories. It can be the same as your true gender identity but it does not have to be.
